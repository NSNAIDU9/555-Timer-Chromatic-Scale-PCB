# 555-Timer-Chromatic-Scale-PCB
This repository contains screenshots of a PCB design created as part of my learning in electronics and PCB design. Features 555 timer based frequency generation, power regulation, basic audio output, and a C4–B4 chromatic scale. Includes schematic, PCB layout (top &amp; bottom), and 3D render. Gerber files are not included due to export limits.
